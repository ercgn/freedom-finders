 ring this fully funded\, two-week summer program in June 2011\, a group 
 of 40 rising juniors and seniors will be introduced to the fundamentals

 attract promising students from under-represented minorities.  While we

 how to inspire people\, as well as manage capital\, materials and ideas\

DESCRIPTION:The Foundation has three locations: New York City\, Little R
 ock\, Arkansas\, and Boston\, Massachusetts. The Little Rock and Boston 
 offices focus on Foundation business\, respectively the Presidential Lib
 rary in Little Rock\, and the Clinton HIV/AIDS and Clinton Climate Initi
 atives in Boston. We have two offices in New York City: the Harlem offic
 e is the official office of the former President and the place where his
  activities for non-profit and for-profit work are determined and organi
 zed. Our mid-town office houses the Clinton Global Initiative operation.
 \nThe intern semesters mirror that of the school year\, with the fall te
 rm extending from September through December\, the spring term from late
  January through May\, and the summer term from June through August. Dur
 ing the fall and spring sessions we require a minimum of 20 hours per we
 ek and in the summer 30. No matter which branch of the Clinton Foundatio
 n you work in\, you will experience some similarities between each of th
 e programs:\n•Hands-on experience: Interns have the responsibility of in
 teracting directly with staff\, volunteers\, and Foundation Stakeholders
 \, in such activities as communications\, development\, and scheduling. 
 Through firsthand experience you learn how the Clinton Foundation functi
 ons on a daily basis\, and assist with this process directly. \n•Helping
  to accomplish the Clinton Foundation's goal: In each intern class\, we 
 look for candidates who are diligent\, resourceful\, professional\, and 
 intellectually curious\, as we believe these qualities in our interns re
 inforce and bring us closer to the Clinton Foundation's mission of meeti
 ng the challenges of global interdependence. \n•Brown Bag Lecture Series
 : Each semester\, the Clinton Foundation hosts a number of Brown Bag Lun
 ches\, where guests\, including senior administration officials and lead
 ers in politics\, business\, entertainment\, and journalism discuss issu
 es of the day over an informal lunch.\nApplication deadline for the Spri
 ng 2011 term is November 15\, 2010.  Please log on to www.clintonfoundat

 ation.

 rogramming (in\naddition to the opportunities provided specifically for 
 CMU\nstudents by the Center for International Relations and Politics).\n
 Each program differs in the academic tracks offered\, as well as\nthe na
 ture\, logistics\, and location of the program.\n\nDue to agreements in 
 place with each program\, Carnegie Mellon\nstudents must apply through t
 he Carnegie Mellon University\nWashington Semester Program (CMUWSP)\, ra
 ther than directly\nto any outside program. Doing so ensures that studen
 ts’\napplications will be appropriately considered\, that students will 
 be\neligible for tuition discounts where application\, and that eligible
 \nstudents will be able to apply for Friedman Fellowship funding.\n\nCos
 t\n\nStudents who attend The Semester in Washington with\nGeorgetown Uni
 versity’s School of Continuing Studies and the\nWashington Semester with
  American University continue to pay\ntuition to Carnegie Mellon for the
  semester in which they are in\nWashington\, D.C. and receive the same f
 inancial aid package.\n\nStudents attending the Capital Semester with Th
 e Fund for\nAmerican Studies will pay tuition directly to TFAS for the\n
 semester in Washington. These students may only utilize federal\nand sta
 te financial aid while in Washington.\n\nAll students are responsible fo
 r paying other fees\, such as room\nand board\, to the institution in Wa
 shington. Please discuss cost\nquestions further with the CMUWSP Advisor
 .\n\nAll information sessions will take place in Baker Hall 154R from 4:
 30-5:30 PM. Refreshments will be provided.

DESCRIPTION:From embassy headquarters to non-governmental organizations\
 , from think tanks to lobby groups and advocacy organizations\, and from
  consulting firms to media outlets\, Washington\, D.C. is the capital of
  the United States and a focal point for many of the world’s internation
 al and public policy activities. Undergraduates from any course of study
 \, who would value first- hand policy experience\, are invited to apply 
 to Carnegie Mellon University’s Washington Semester Program\, sponsored 
 by the university’s Center for International Relations and Politics (CIR
 P). Through this semester-long program\, students live\, work\, and stud
 y in Washington\, D.C. Students establish direct contact with political\
 , business\, and community leaders\, while learning about the most press
 ing policy issues of the day. The Center for International Relations and
  Politics sponsors policy events and forums in Washington for CMU studen
 ts participating in the program to further enrich their experience and t
 o help them better understand how Washington functions as a hub of inter
 national and public policy decision making. Program Options Once accepte
 d to the CMU Washington Semester Program\, students have the option of e
 nrolling in one of three partner programs located in Washington\, D.C. E
 ach program allows students to earn 12-16 credits (36-48 units at Carneg
 ie Mellon) and revolves around three core components: an internship\, ac
 ademic coursework\, and metacurricular programming (in addition to the o
 pportunities provided specifically for CMU students by the Center for In
 ternational Relations and Politics). Each program differs in the academi
 c tracks offered\, as well as the nature\, logistics\, and location of t
 he program. Due to agreements in place with each program\, Carnegie Mell
 on students must apply through the Carnegie Mellon University Washington
  Semester Program (CMUWSP)\, rather than directly to any outside program
 . Doing so ensures that students’ applications will be appropriately con
 sidered\, that students will be eligible for tuition discounts where app
 lication\, and that eligible students will be able to apply for Friedman
  Fellowship funding. Cost Students who attend The Semester in Washington
  with Georgetown University’s School of Continuing Studies and the Washi
 ngton Semester with American University continue to pay tuition to Carne
 gie Mellon for the semester in which they are in Washington\, D.C. and r
 eceive the same financial aid package. Students attending the Capital Se
 mester with The Fund for American Studies will pay tuition directly to T
 FAS for the semester in Washington. These students may only utilize fede
 ral and state financial aid while in Washington. All students are respon
 sible for paying other fees\, such as room and board\, to the institutio
 n in Washington. Please discuss cost questions further with the CMUWSP A
 dvisor.\n\n All information sessions will take place in Baker Hall 154R 
 from 4:30-5:30 PM. Refreshments will be provided.

LOCATION:
DESCRIPTION:The Foundation has three locations: New York City\, Little R
 ock\, Arkansas\, and Boston\, Massachusetts. The Little Rock and Boston 
 offices focus on Foundation business\, respectively the Presidential Lib
 rary in Little Rock\, and the Clinton HIV/AIDS and Clinton Climate Initi
 atives in Boston. We have two offices in New York City: the Harlem offic
 e is the official office of the former President and the place where his
  activities for non-profit and for-profit work are determined and organi
 zed. Our mid-town office houses the Clinton Global Initiative operation.
 \nThe intern semesters mirror that of the school year\, with the fall te
 rm extending from September through December\, the spring term from late
  January through May\, and the summer term from June through August. Dur
 ing the fall and spring sessions we require a minimum of 20 hours per we
 ek and in the summer 30. No matter which branch of the Clinton Foundatio
 n you work in\, you will experience some similarities between each of th
 e programs:\n•Hands-on experience: Interns have the responsibility of in
 teracting directly with staff\, volunteers\, and Foundation Stakeholders
 \, in such activities as communications\, development\, and scheduling. 
 Through firsthand experience you learn how the Clinton Foundation functi
 ons on a daily basis\, and assist with this process directly. \n•Helping
  to accomplish the Clinton Foundation's goal: In each intern class\, we 
 look for candidates who are diligent\, resourceful\, professional\, and 
 intellectually curious\, as we believe these qualities in our interns re
 inforce and bring us closer to the Clinton Foundation's mission of meeti
 ng the challenges of global interdependence. \n•Brown Bag Lecture Series
 : Each semester\, the Clinton Foundation hosts a number of Brown Bag Lun
 ches\, where guests\, including senior administration officials and lead
 ers in politics\, business\, entertainment\, and journalism discuss issu
 es of the day over an informal lunch.\nApplication deadline for the Spri
 ng 2011 term is November 15\, 2010.  Please log on to www.clintonfoundat
 ion.org/internships for more information and to access the online applic
 ation.

LOCATION:
DESCRIPTION:From embassy headquarters to non-governmental organizations\
 , from think tanks to lobby groups and advocacy organizations\, and from
  consulting firms to media outlets\, Washington\, D.C. is the capital of
  the United States and a focal point for many of the world’s internation
 al and public policy activities. Undergraduates from any course of study
 \, who would value first- hand policy experience\, are invited to apply 
 to Carnegie Mellon University’s Washington Semester Program\, sponsored 
 by the university’s Center for International Relations and Politics (CIR
 P). Through this semester-long program\, students live\, work\, and stud
 y in Washington\, D.C. Students establish direct contact with political\
 , business\, and community leaders\, while learning about the most press
 ing policy issues of the day. The Center for International Relations and
  Politics sponsors policy events and forums in Washington for CMU studen
 ts participating in the program to further enrich their experience and t
 o help them better understand how Washington functions as a hub of inter
 national and public policy decision making. Program Options Once accepte
 d to the CMU Washington Semester Program\, students have the option of e
 nrolling in one of three partner programs located in Washington\, D.C. E
 ach program allows students to earn 12-16 credits (36-48 units at Carneg
 ie Mellon) and revolves around three core components: an internship\, ac
 ademic coursework\, and metacurricular programming (in addition to the o
 pportunities provided specifically for CMU students by the Center for In
 ternational Relations and Politics). Each program differs in the academi
 c tracks offered\, as well as the nature\, logistics\, and location of t
 he program. Due to agreements in place with each program\, Carnegie Mell
 on students must apply through the Carnegie Mellon University Washington
  Semester Program (CMUWSP)\, rather than directly to any outside program
 . Doing so ensures that students’ applications will be appropriately con
 sidered\, that students will be eligible for tuition discounts where app
 lication\, and that eligible students will be able to apply for Friedman
  Fellowship funding. Cost Students who attend The Semester in Washington
  with Georgetown University’s School of Continuing Studies and the Washi
 ngton Semester with American University continue to pay tuition to Carne
 gie Mellon for the semester in which they are in Washington\, D.C. and r
 eceive the same financial aid package. Students attending the Capital Se
 mester with The Fund for American Studies will pay tuition directly to T
 FAS for the semester in Washington. These students may only utilize fede
 ral and state financial aid while in Washington. All students are respon
 sible for paying other fees\, such as room and board\, to the institutio
 n in Washington. Please discuss cost questions further with the CMUWSP A
 dvisor. \n\nDeadline to apply is March 1. Admission decisions will be an
 nounced March 15.

DESCRIPTION:http://premba.som.yale.edu/?q=faq\n\nThe Yale School of Mana
 gement Pre-MBA Leadership Program is a highly selective\, two-week summe
 r program aimed at college juniors and seniors and recent college gradua
 tes from populations typically under-represented in management education
 . We introduce you to the fundamentals of management education and give 
 you the tools necessary to hone your individual leadership skills.\n\nDu
 ring this fully funded\, two-week summer program in June 2011\, a group 
 of 40 rising juniors and seniors will be introduced to the fundamentals 
 of management education\, and have the opportunity develop their individ
 ual leadership skills.\n\nThe Pre-MBA Leadership Program at SOM aims to 
 attract promising students from under-represented minorities.  While we 
 welcome applicants of every academic profile\, we hope to attract studen
 ts from beyond the traditional pre-MBA tracks.\n\nThis emphasis on leade
 rship for the greater good flows from the mission of the School of Manag
 ement: to educate leaders for business and society.  When students know 
 how to inspire people\, as well as manage capital\, materials and ideas\
 , they become more potent agents of change.  We hope they will return to
  their respective institutions and enrich their community with not only 
 these skills\, but a (re)focused sense of purpose that will guide them f
 or many years to come.\n\nIf you have any questions\, please do not hesi
