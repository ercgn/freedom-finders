Things to do: Freedom Finders
Every line here is a function to be coded separately
- Take multiple ics files -> how to do?
- parse ics file -> output array of all the events
	-> hash dates
	-> put into array/map?
- (y) sort (quick!)
- do that parantheses thing -> output array of "Free times"

- date to hash
- hash to date (wait what was the hash idea again?)
- take options to set variables for START_TIME -> get from lifes, DURATION=week, MIN_INTERVAL=30(minutes)
